# Question 2 (total 12 marks)

Write a C program that performs the following tasks:

**(a)** Ask the user to enter two numbers (base and height of a triangle). Implement a function that calculates the area of the triangle (area = 0.5 × base × height) **using only addition** (repeated addition for multiplication). Print the result.

**Note:** Use of * or / operators or existing mathematical library is **not allowed**. **(3 marks)**

**Hint:** Both base and height can be decimal numbers.

**(b)** Prime numbers are natural numbers greater than 1 that have no positive divisors other than 1 and themselves. The sequence begins 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, and so on.

- **(i)** Ask the user to input a positive number n. Check if the user has entered a valid number. If not, prompt the user to re-enter a positive number until this condition has been met. **(1 mark)**

- **(ii)** Calculate and output the first n prime numbers. Create a function to check if a number is prime. **(3 marks)**
  
  **Hint:** Check divisibility from 2 to the square root of the number.

**(c)** Generate a diamond pattern with numbers. For n=3:
```
    1
  1 2 1
1 2 3 2 1
  1 2 1
    1
```
Generate this diamond pattern where the middle row has **n** elements, using the positive number n entered by the user in (b). **(5 marks)**

**Hint:** Combine ascending and descending triangles with proper spacing.
