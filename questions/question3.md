# Question 3 (total 12 marks)

Write a C program that performs the following tasks:

**(a)** Ask the user to enter two numbers. Implement a function that performs multiplication **using only addition and subtraction operators**. Print the result.

**Note:** Use of * operator or existing mathematical library is **not allowed**. **(3 marks)**

**Hint:** Both numbers can be negative. Think about how to handle signs.

**(b)** The factorial of a number n (written as n!) is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to n. For example: 5! = 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 = 120

- **(i)** Ask the user to input a positive number n. Check if the user has entered a valid number. If not, prompt the user to re-enter a positive number until this condition has been met. **(1 mark)**

- **(ii)** Calculate and output the factorial of n. Ensure that the program does **not use iterative methods** for the calculation. **(3 marks)**
  
  **Hint:** Use recursion. Remember that 0! = 1.

**(c)** Generate an inverted Pascal's triangle starting from row n down to row 0.

Expected output for n = 4:
```
1 4 6 4 1
 1 3 3 1
  1 2 1
   1 1
    1
```
Generate this inverted Pascal's triangle with the starting row equal to the **positive number n** entered by the user in (b). **(5 marks)**

**Hint:** Start from the largest row and work backwards with proper spacing.
