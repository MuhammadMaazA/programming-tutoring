# Question 1 (total 12 marks)

Write a C program that performs the following tasks:

**(a)** Ask the user to enter two numbers. Implement a function to calculate the remainder when dividing the first by the second **using only arithmetic operators** (no % operator allowed). Handle negative numbers. Print the result.

**Note:** Use of % operator or existing mathematical library is **not allowed**. **(3 marks)**

**Hint:** Both numbers can be negative.

**(b)** The sum of first n natural numbers is given by: 1 + 2 + 3 + ... + n

- **(i)** Ask the user to input a positive number n. Check if the user has entered a valid number. If not, prompt the user to re-enter a positive number until this condition has been met. **(1 mark)**

- **(ii)** Calculate and output the sum of the first n natural numbers. Ensure that the program does **not use iterative methods** for the calculation. **(3 marks)**
  
  **Hint:** Use recursion.

**(c)** Generate a number pyramid where each row shows multiples of the row number. For n=4:
```
1
2 4
3 6 9
4 8 12 16
```
Generate this pyramid with the number of rows equal to the **positive number n** entered by the user in (b). **(5 marks)**

**Hint:** Each element in row r at position c equals r × c.
