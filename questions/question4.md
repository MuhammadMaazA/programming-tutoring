# Question 4 (total 12 marks)


#### Exercise 1:
Write a C program that:

a) Declares and initializes two floats and then declares and initializes two pointers, one for each float.

b) For each float, print its value, address, and memory size (in bytes).

c) For each pointer, print its value, address, and the value it is pointing to.

d) Using only pointers, multiply the two floats together and store the result in the first float. Now print the value stored in each of the two floats.

**(1+1+1+1 marks)**

**Expected output:**
```
The value of x is: ________________
The address of x is: ____________________
The size of x is: ________________
The value of y is: ________________
The address of y is: ________________
The size of y is: ________________

The value of ptrx is: ________________
The address of ptrx is: ________________
The value ptrx is pointing to is: ________________
The value of ptry is: ________________
The address of ptry is: ________________
The value ptry is pointing to is: ________________

The value of x is: ________________
The value of y is: ________________
```

#### Exercise 2:
Write a C program to find and replace the maximum element in an array. The program should do the following:

a. Ask the user to enter the size of array. Followed by asking the user to input elements in array.

   Print the entered array. **(2 marks)**

b. Find the maximum element in the array. Print its value and the position it is found at.
   
   **Hint:** Use sequential search (linear scan) to locate elements. **(4 marks)**

c. Replace the maximum element with the minimum value from the array and print the updated array after replacement.
   
   **Hint:** First find the minimum, then replace the maximum. **(2 marks)**
